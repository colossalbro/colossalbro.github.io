## Who am I?
Hi! I'm a curious individual who's been exploring Offensive Security for past 5 years. I've worked professionally as a Penetration tester and Offensive security Consultant for 3 years where I've taken apart numerous pieces of software and environments in search of security vulnerabilities with devastating impact. I hold the [OSCP](https://www.credential.net/841c797f-4678-4b0f-b145-56e777306238#acc.Fk3jd5yQ) from offsec and you can find a more professional summary about me in my [Professional Resumé](https://1drv.ms/b/c/881b38a988aab275/Ee8Hgj9o4wlMghUCcIvKI-0BMM2MIJbLTMauXMGbKw_SKQ?e=bYBnnO)



## Why this Blog?
I created this primarily to mind dump experiences i've had on various pentesting & offensive security  engagements. I'll cover my technical workflow, road blocks I hit at various points, how I overcame said road blocks, exciting milestones I reached and more. Hopefully I can look back at these when I feel burned out or down - to remind myself that I. Am. Awesome!

And, who knows? Maybe someone else can learn a thing or two from what I write here ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## What I'm currently working on
### Professionally
I'm currently working with brilliant minds at [Migranium](https://migranium.com) to deliver an  AI-powered solution to meet healthcare challenges in Canada. To summarize, I'm in charge of ensuring Migranium is not breached! I do this by:
- reviewing and testing security policies to ensure they work
- reviewing and investigating alerts I recieve from the SIEM
- pentesting new features before they are released to production
- reviewing attack surface through automated means - I leverage [Project Discovery](https://github.com/projectdiscovery) tools for this
- and more.

### Personally
On a personal level, I'm working on upping my Defensive Security game. My goal is to work as a Cybersecurity Engineer. I'm currently learning DevSecOps at York University, Canada. In my free time, I try to read articles and books that cover proper software devlopment principles.
